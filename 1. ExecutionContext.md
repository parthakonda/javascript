## Execution Context, Scope, Execution chain and Closure Scope
   
 ### Global Execution Context
 - Reads the code
 - Creates global object
 - Create this object
 - Setup memory for vars and functions
 - Assign default value as undefined to the variables - Hoisting.
  
  ### Local/Function Execution Context
  - Reads the function
  - Creates arguments object
  - Creates this object
  - Setup memory for vars and functions
  - Assign default value as undefined to the variables - Hoisting
  - After execution and it will be added to execution stack

  ## Scope
  - Whatever the vars defined in the context are bound to their scope.
  - All inner execution context can access to their parent scope.
  - It can be applied any nested levels.

  ## Closure scope
  - Whenever the function is created, it will be created with its scope.
  - Whenever its execution is completed then it arguments will be passed to its inner scoped.

## Overall - Execution Context
  - Creation - Assign default values to default (Hoisting), creates global/argument object, assign memory
  - Execution - It will creates the scope and after this it will create closure scope. 
  - Scope chain - It will look for the current scope and if it doesnot find then it will look for the parent scope.
  - Garbage Collection - It will remove the memory after the execution is completed.
